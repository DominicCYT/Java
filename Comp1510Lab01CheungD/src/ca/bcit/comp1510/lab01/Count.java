 Documentation Guidelines F - List two things you could imagine yourself or 
 someone else doing:
 
 1)Aligning the curly braces. Sometimes I see different conventions
 where the opening curly brace  is at the end of the line instead of at the 
 beginning of a new line.
 
 2)Identifier Cases - I may accidentally mix up title cases with lower case for 
 class and variables. */
